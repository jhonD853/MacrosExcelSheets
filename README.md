  2  Open the file containing the macro: If you have the file with the macro you want to copy, open it.

  3  Access the script editor: Click on Tools in the menu bar, then select Script editor. This will open the Google Apps Script editor.

  4  Locate the macro: In the script editor, you'll see various functions (macros) written in the file. Locate the code for the macro you want to copy.

  5  Copy the code: Select the macro code you want to copy, right-click, and choose Copy, or press Ctrl + C on your keyboard.

 6 Open the target file: Now, open the Google Sheets file where you want to paste the macro.

 7  Access the script editor of the target file: Click on Tools > Script editor in the target file to open the Google Apps Script editor.

 8  Paste the macro code: In the script editor of the target file, create a new script by clicking the + icon or File > New and then select Script. Then, paste the code you copied by pressing Ctrl + V or selecting Paste from the context menu.

 9   Save the script: Give the new script a name and click on File > Save to save the code.

10    Test the macro: Once you've saved the code, you can test the macro by running it in the target file.
